# Full-Stack application

## Overview
This is a C# Full-Stack Application following a layered architecture (Repository, Logic, Endpoint, Client). It supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Albums, Music Records, and Producers, using an In-Memory Database (models stored in the Models/ directory).<br>

The front end consists of:
- WPF Application (desktop)
- JavaScript Web App with SignalR for real-time synchronization between clients

<br>
To ensure reliability, unit tests were written using NUnit and Moq.
